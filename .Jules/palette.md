**Learning:** Icon-only buttons in modals (Close, Like, Download) must have ARIA labels to be accessible. Modals should also support the 'Escape' key for closing and have the appropriate ARIA roles (dialog, aria-modal).
**Action:** Always include ARIA labels for icon-only components and implement keyboard listeners for standard modal interactions.
